### Ancestral recombination of the Coronaviridae ORF8 region

### Errata

The BALi-Phy run for NRR blocks 3 and 4 were accidentally assigned the same
name as the run for NRR block 4. Fortunately, BALi-Phy creates a new analysis
directory for each run, so the analysis was not affected. I've renamed the
directory and corrected the config file for BALi-Phy so that readers may re-run
it correctly, but I have not otherwise modified the output. As a result, the
system metadata for that run has an incorrect name. This metadata is not used
in any part of the downstream analysis.
